# WeatherApp
I developed a weather application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Upon entering a city name, the application provides comprehensive weather details including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. In case of an incorrect city name input, an error message "Invalid city name" is displayed.
